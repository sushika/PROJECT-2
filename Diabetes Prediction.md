Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin.

Prevalence In India:

The reasons for the escalation in diabetes in Indians are i) increased insulin resistance, ii) stronger genetic factors and iii) environmental factors particularly associated with urbanization

The estimates in 2019 showed that 77 million individuals had diabetes in India, which is expected to rise to over 134 million by 2045. Approximately 57% of these individuals remain undiagnosed Thus, Inorder to tackle the problem of being undiagnosed this model is being developed i.e. Diabetes Prediction.
